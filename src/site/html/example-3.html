<p>This example shows how the objects imported via an <code>$xref</code> key
can have additional keys which will be merged in with the referenced object.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p><b>input.yaml</b>
<pre>
paths:
  /thing:
    get:
      # hashes in the path toggle between '/'-as-JSON-Pointer separators 
      # and '/' as characters in the key
      $xref: 'paths.yaml#/paths/#/thing#/get'

    post:
      # objects defined by xref can have other fields defined 
      # which are merged in with the xref'ed object
      $xref: 'paths.yaml#/paths/#/thing#/post'
      parameters:
        old-parameter:
          description: some old parameter whose definition has changed
        new-parameter: 
          description: the new parameter in v2 of the API that isn't in v1
